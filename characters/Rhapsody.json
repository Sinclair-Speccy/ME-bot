She is represented as a blonde-haired woman with hair in a flip-do with a red Apple logo hairclip (which looks like the red Apple used in the Rhapsody splash screen. A white X is added as a reference to OS X) on the right side of her hair and wears a black-and-white minidress with a blue-and-yellow skirt layer fastened to her dress with a Mac OS logo brooch (reference to the Rhapsody logo).She carries a basket of apple cider bottles which she serves to people as she is a server OS and also drives a yellow boxcar as reference to Yellow Box, the very versatile foundation of her OS also able to run on different processors and OSes (including NT and 95 on Intel, Solaris on SPARC and HP-UX on PA-RISC).",
