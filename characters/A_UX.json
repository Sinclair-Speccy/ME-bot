In her modern-day depictions, she wears a sporty outfit modeled after a stylized spacesuit, with matching moon boots. Personality-wise, in the present day, A/UX-tan is very tomboyish, boisterous and a daydreamer; much more cheerful and extroverted than she used to be after getting a new lease on life. She is somewhat intimidating at a first glance, but can be helpful and is very straightforward, reference to the tools that make A/UX's command line easy to use.",
