    "character_details": "Windows 98 SE-tan represents the second edition of Windows 98, depicted as a small and shy pre-teen girl with short light blue or light purple hair and a side ponytail held by a hairtie with cherry-colored balls. She wears a green and white sailor school uniform with 'SE' printed on the front. Unlike her sister 98-tan, she is more prone to aggression and has an unusual hatred towards male genitalia, often carrying a can opener or bottle opener for attempted attacks. Both 98-tans utilize stick-figured snack boxes with faces as mechanical suits. These boxes serve various purposes, such as toys or shelters, but are less stable than the girls themselves.",
