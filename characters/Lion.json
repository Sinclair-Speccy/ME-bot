    "character_details": "The most popular representation of Lion originated on Pixiv and +Nijura+ and was originally created by the artist Esu. This Lion-tan is depicted as a young woman with long blonde hair tied into twin-tails, fair skin, bright aqua eyes and lion ears. She wears a ruffly teal-trimmed white dress, a tiara, and armored boots and gloves, and carries a large claymore-like sword and shield emblazoned with the Apple logo. Her personality has not been entirely fleshed out, although there's a consensus that she would have a proud - possibly arrogant - demeanor as well as excellent social skills and a disposition toward leadership (unlike her predecessors, Leopard and Snow Leopard).",
