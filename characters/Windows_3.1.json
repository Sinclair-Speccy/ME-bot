    "character_details": "Windows 3.1-tan is depicted as a frail grey-haired young girl in a long frilly violet gown, often accompanied by a black cat or a small black-haired catgirl in a nurse's outfit. She has a quiet personality, but more cheerful depictions have emerged. She shares a close bond with NT-tan, 95-tan, and MS-DOS-tan, while having distant relationships with others in the Windows family. Her memories of her childhood with 1.0-tan and 2.0-tan are patchy due to their exile during the OS Wars, which deeply affected her. Despite her distance from newer generations, recent portrayals suggest she may be healing and willing to reconnect with her family.",
