    "character_details": "The only Apple II-tan identified to date is meant as a catch-all design for all variants of the 8-bit Apple II computer. These include the Apple II, II Plus, IIe, IIc, IIGS, (and also the Apple III until a separate III-tan design was made), in addition to all the operating systems released for this platform, such as AppleDOS and ProDOS. She is described as beginning life as an idealistic revolutionary, but over the years has settled into a slow-paced but still stimulating life of a natural farmer. She loves hard work, talks with an accent, and has a friendly, witty and rugged personality that sets her in sharp contrast to the latest generation of Mac-tans.",
