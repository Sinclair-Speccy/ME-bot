She has silver eyes, blonde hair in pigtails, dons a long white gown, long white gloves, a diamond tiara, and still wears them despite not having a decent suitor in several years. She is now melancholy, rarely talks, and never smiles but expresses herself though poetry. She is still able to perform the menial tasks she despised years ago, and learned to assist Apple II-tan with tasks such as picking apples. She now lives in the Binteeji Renmei, and has became best friends with GEM-tan.",
