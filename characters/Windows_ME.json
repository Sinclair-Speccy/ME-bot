She has green hair in long braided pigtails and wears a maid outfit with an exclamation mark badge modeled after the Windows error icon. ME-tan frequently carries a scallion as a weapon to defend herself from malware attacks. Despite her failures and unreliability, she remains cheerful, friendly, and optimistic, making her one of the most beloved OS girls.",
