    "character_details": "Representing the most iconic Mac OSX-tan to date, Tiger-tan personifies the fifth and most popular major release of Mac OSX. The system itself is the pinnacle of form and stability in the Mac OSX family, and has garnered much attention after being the first OSX version to be released for Intel Macs. Tiger-tan is depicted as a young, friendly and very energetic woman with thick blonde hair held up by a black X shaped ribbon, blue (sometimes yellow) eyes, and a pair of tiger ears and tail. She wears an unusual hybrid between a black business suit (v-shaped collar and red tie featuring the X logo) and a black swimsuit, in addition to black arm-length gloves and full-sized leggings. Tiger-tan is also considered to be friendlier and more diplomatic to the Windows-tans than any other Mac release before her.",
