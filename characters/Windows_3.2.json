    "character_details": "Windows 3.2-tan personifies the Simplified Chinese version of Windows 3.1, designed as a frail grey-haired young woman in traditional Chinese clothes, adorned with a 3.2 brooch. She has a black rabbit companion representing DOS. Although she resembles Windows 3.1-tan, she is not her twin and was raised separately in the Chinese Windows branch. Years as a wanderer have made her a skilled survivalist, though she remains unaware of many Windows-tans, including her sisters. She eventually befriended 95 OSR 2.1-tan and 2.5-tan, forming close familial ties.",
