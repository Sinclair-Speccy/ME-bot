    "character_details": "Mac-tan is most commonly viewed as a catch-all OS-tan for all Macintosh systems. She tends to have blonde hair and a platinum-white bodysuit. Early depictions of her especially often feature a large apple on her head. Mac OS-tan was perhaps the first commonly-known and widely-supported Mac-tan during the early days of the OS-tan phenomenon. Given the popularity of the Windows platform, it is likely that Mac OS-tan was simply meant to be a standalone personification of the Mac Operating System, in the same way that Linux-tan was meant to be a lump-sum of all Linux distributions.",
