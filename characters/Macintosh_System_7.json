    "character_details": "System 7-tan has long dark blue hair with green eyes, her hair is topped with a green 7-shaped cowlick, she wears glasses, a blue pinstriped suit with a rainbow Apple tie and black boots. Her blue outfit, hair, and being a blues singer are a reference to System 7's first codename of Blue. Her being a former 1920's-style gangster and wearing a pinstriped suit are references to System 7.5's codename of Capone. After overcoming her depression, she is still stoic and non-chalant, but a lot more confident, but in a more constructive way than the confidence she had in her youth. She still wields the katana she used before and during the OS Wars; after the defeat she suffered, she lost interest and practice in it for years, but learned to keep training, wielding it more artfully and responsibly than before as a form of self-discipline.",
