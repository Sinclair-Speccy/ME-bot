Her outfits are in black, white and grey. She is energetic, charismatic, and is always trying to be helpful, but is also scatterbrained and has a one-track mind. She struggles with some tasks, but is resourceful, and willing to push herself to her limits to get them done. She is cheerful, but had lived in fear a lot in the past, and is more easygoing and laid-back now.",
