    "character_details": "Mac OS 9 is currently the most common and adored Mac OS girl. OS9-tan is the personification for Mac OS 9, better known as Sonata, which is the first and most well-known codename for this system. Japanese artists frequently refer to her as Sonata-sensei. She has blonde hair that varies in length from artist to artist; having either short, straight hair, or longer and wavy hair. Both variations are about equally common. Unlike MacOS-tan, she is usually seen as cheerful, modest and responsible like 2k-tan, much due to the fact that she is one of the few maids in the Mac group. She is always responsible for taking care of the OSX girls. Her main hobby is art (mostly painting).",
