The first known representation originated on +Nijiura+ and is a pink-haired leopard girl in a teal+black+white dress with a Time Machine logo brooch and it is the more popular one. At least according to various OSC stories, Leopard-tan is a physics enthusiast and time-traveler whose intellect borders on genius. Fascinated with history, she goes back in time only to observes how things were in the past, with no intention or ability to change the past (referencing Leopard's Time Machine feature, which keeps the user's files archived as they were in the past).",
