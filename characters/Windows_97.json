    "character_details": "Windows 97-tan is depicted as a little girl with brown hair in braids, wearing a traditional Chinese-style dress shirt. Her hair is styled in buns with braids, adorned with tassels, and she has a Windows logo brooch on her collar. She wears a school swimsuit under her short dress, and the kanji for '97' is displayed on her forehead. Cheerful and energetic, she envies the figure of Windows XP MediaCenter Edition-tan and has a running gag of trying to pass herself off as Windows 7-tan to escape obscurity. Her origins are unclear; she may have been exiled from the Windows Family or may never have existed. Windows 97-tan lives as a Wanderer, mainly knowing other Windows-tans who are also wanderers.",
