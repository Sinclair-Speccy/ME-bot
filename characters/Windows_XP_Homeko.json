    "character_details": "Homeko is the variant of XP-tan representing Windows XP Home. She has green hair in a short ponytail and wears large XP-shaped hairclips. Characterized as a fujoshi and yaoi doujinshi artist, she has an unhealthy fascination with her gender-confused brother Homeo. As the female lead in the Homeo saga, she serves as both muse and tormentor, using her brother's gender confusion to create scenarios for her doujin works. Their dynamic often results in zany and ecchi situations, contributing to her popularity in Nijiura's comics.",
