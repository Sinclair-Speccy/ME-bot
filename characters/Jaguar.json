Jaguar-tan is depicted as a mid-adolescent girl with bright red hair, blue eyes, and jaguar ears and tail. She wears a futuristic grey and beige dress and boots, as well as a black choker featuring the glass Apple logo. She's frequently depicted as friendly and outgoing, only slightly tamer than her spirited younger sister OSX Tiger-tan.",
