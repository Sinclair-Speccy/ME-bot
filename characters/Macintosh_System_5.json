    "character_details": "This more common appearance as System 5-tan is a phantom, usually invisible to those outside the Mac family, her existence is believed to only be an urban legend by outsiders. She can be seen by the Classic Mac-tans, plus A/UX-tan and the early OSX-tans due to their compatibility with the Classic Mac. It is unclear if the later OSX-tans (OSX Leopard and later) can see her, or if she can choose to make herself seen to outsiders she trusts enough.",
