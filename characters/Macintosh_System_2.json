    "character_details": "Macintosh System 2-tan looks a lot like System 1-tan but has two straight side ponytails on her right side, and wears a grey dress with a pleated skirt, and wears a sash over her dress. She carries a Newspeak-to-Oldspeak dictionary with her, and brings puppets with her when presenting her lectures on literature and why old technology is better. Despite thinking that old technology is better, she introduced some innovations. She is observant, witty, and intelligent; also more calm and stable than System 1-tan, but is uptight and does not tolerate getting ignored.",
