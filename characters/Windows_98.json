    "character_details": "Windows 98-tan represents the first edition of Windows 98, depicted as a shy, small pre-teen girl with short navy blue hair and a clip shaped like '98'. She wears a schoolgirl outfit featuring a sleeveless white blouse, blue skirt, dark shoes, long socks, and gloves. Commonly seen with 98SE-tan, she is sometimes portrayed as a futanari and is said to fancy Homeo. In early designs, she was represented by a stick-limbed snack-box with a face, based on a toy from the anime 'Konjiki no Gash Bell!!/Zatch Bell!'. She and 98SE-tan pilot mechanical boxes, which serve multiple purposes. While 95 OSR 2.5-tan views her as a rival, 98-tan sees her as a friend.",
