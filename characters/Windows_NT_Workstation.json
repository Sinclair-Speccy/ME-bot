She has blue hair in a ponytail that transitions into floppy dog ears, a dog tail, and a collar. Her appearance includes gloves and boots shaped like paws, and she typically wears a long dress. Inu-T is depicted as a young girl with a carefree, sweet, and spunky demeanor, often seen as daughterly and close to NT-tan. She has gained popularity, particularly on the Futaba image boards, becoming more common than the original NT-tan.",
