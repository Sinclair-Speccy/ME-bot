    "character_details": "Macintosh System 7.5-tan is fairly recently-established character, represented as a blue-eyed blonde-haired woman in a light blue dress, white top and taskbar-style armbands. She bears a strong resemblance to a long-haired Mac OS9-tan, and more so resembles 9.2-tan, but her personality is opposite of theirs; 7.5-tan wields large rifles, is serious, disgruntled and often trigger-happy, but has a soft spot for a few people.She is usually friendly towards the young OSX-kun catboys, but still willing to enforce punishment if necessary. In another of the first known comics pages featuring her, 3.1-tan is oblivious to 7.5-tan's disgruntled personality and even calls her Al-chan.",
