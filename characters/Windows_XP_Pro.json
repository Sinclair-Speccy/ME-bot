    "character_details": "XP-tan is the personification of Windows XP Professional, depicted as a dark-haired girl with ribbons in her hair and an XP hair ornament. She is often portrayed in tight clothing and has large breasts, with early outfits being particularly skimpy. XP-tan is known for being somewhat shallow and promiscuous, reflecting the criticisms of Windows XP during its release. However, her character has evolved to be seen as more reliable and diplomatic, particularly after the release of Windows Vista. She is involved in the Homeo saga and works alongside Mac OSX characters.",
