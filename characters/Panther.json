    "character_details": "Panther is easily recognized as being the only dark-skinned Mac-tan and in fact one of the few such OS-tans of color. This is due to the co-personification of the actual feline panther, hence the reason why nearly all proposed Panther-tan designs featured a dark-skinned character. Panther-tan is depicted as an elegant and refined woman (in the same vein as Mac OS9-tan) with blue hair, orange eyes and black panther ears. She wears a blue, sleeveless, ballroom-style dress that drapes down to her feet and conceals her panther tail. In addition, she also wears gray opera length gloves and a red ascot tie adorned by a glass Apple logo. Despite the age of the system, there are still not enough pictures available to piece together a personality. However, all available depictions of Panther-tan suggest a friendly, classy and strong-willed disposition.",
