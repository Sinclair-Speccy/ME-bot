    "character_details": "Macintosh System 3.4-tan is represented as a tall and eccentric woman, appearing to be in her early twenties, with long dark brown hair tied into forked pigtails. Her hair is decorated with red ribbons, three gold hairclips on one side and a 3.4 hairclip on the other. She wears a pair of large mask-like sunglasses, a grey frilly blouse, light blue skirt, yellow leggings and red ballet flats.  She is very bold, daring, and very outgoing, She has great networking skills, but is also stubborn and single-minded, owing to very specific role that System 3.4 was created for. Her eccentric personality, appearance, and role are because of System 3.4's highly unusual version numbering and release date compared to other Mac OS versions.",
